# Analysis-of-Dota2-Winning-Rate

The main reason we hope to make this project is that, besides the coach accident, there is currently no tool to help the professional team to analyze the data of various professional events. At the same time, for ordinary players, there is no such tool to help them choose a better lineup and improve the winning percentage. We hope that this project will enable all dota2 players to experience better gameplay and helping to improve the player's level at the same time. 

Our target users are mainly professional players. We will summarize the data of each competition over the years, and calculate the winning percentage of various lineups, the anti-method, the winning ratio of the two sides and other data. This will help the professional team members to study the enemy's style of play and taking the correct response.

Our team aim at building a database based on Dota2 heroes' data. It may include basic information about heroes like attributes, winning rate, picking rate, farming efﬁciency and average damage output, labels, etc. The system will provide some labels for users to select, and the system will recommend user the suitable heroes and respective hero tricks. Besides, the system can provide wining rate based on each team heroes’ selection.
